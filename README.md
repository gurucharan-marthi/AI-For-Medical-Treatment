# AI for Medical Treatment on Coursera

Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI

Instructor: Andrew Ng

# Introduction
This repo contains all my work for this specialization. All the code base, quiz questions, screenshot, and images, are taken from, unless specified, AI for Medical Treatment on Coursera. I am a Biomedical Undergraduate and a long time self-taught learner. There are many forums where there are detailed descriptions of the various programs. I understand the hardwork put in to understand the new concepts and debugging your program. Here, I have released the solutions of the assignment **only for your reference purpose**. It can help you save some time in completing the assignment or it can also assist you for the same. Use these only as an aid to solving the programming assignment and the quiz. This course is one of the easiest deep learning course I have ever taken. It explains most of the concepts necessary for AI applications in medicine. It is a treasure given by deeplearning.ai team.
